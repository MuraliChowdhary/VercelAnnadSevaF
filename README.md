# Annadseva - Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the Annadseva project. This React application provides a user-friendly interface for the Annadseva food bank system. The frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these instructions:

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Muralichowdhary/Anadhsevaapp.git
    cd Anadhsevaapp/frontend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you are on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
